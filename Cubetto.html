        <p>There’s no better time than toddler age to start kids on their way to coding success. The years from birth to 5 are a pivotal learning period in a child’s life, and with Cubetto, even kids as young as 3 can learn to code. The best part? No screen time!

Cubetto is designed to mimic the chunky, durable toys that young children are used to playing with. The friendly wooden robot teaches the basics of computer programming through hands-on play and incorporates a coding language that kids can touch and manipulate. Each block is an action — forward, left, right, or function. Kids place the blocks on the control board to tell the robot where to go, hit the blue GO button, and watch as their program is executed. Tactile and inclusive, Cubetto features blocks in different shapes and requires no reading skills, eliminating language barriers. There’s little to no prep time required to use Cubetto, which makes it as fun for educators as for their students!</p>

            <p>The Cubetto Play Set allows children to learn basic programming logic through a tactile programming interface. Children can write real programs for Cubetto, a small robot, using colourful blocks, providing a magical experience that hides all the electronics inside a charming wooden character. Cubetto’s electronics can also double up as a powerful prototyping board. Users can build new robots with simple plug-and-play sensors and an illustrated manual to help guide the experience.</p>
