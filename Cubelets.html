            <p>Cubelets are robot blocks that help teach important problem-solving skills – like collaboration, engineering, design, and computational thinking.You’ve never built with blocks like these. Cubelets are the only way to build a robot where you build with a bunch a of tiny robots. 

Combine the 17 unique kinds of Cubelets in different ways to create countless robot constructions. Every design is a new robot construction and it all starts when you combine the three basic categories of Cubelets. </p>

            <p>Cubelets are robot blocks that make it fast and easy to engage children as young as four in learning by building robots. There’s no wrong way to build with Cubelets, so it is remarkably easy to transform these blocks into brilliant bundles of robotic curiosity.

You don’t need to know how to code or wire to construct robots with Cubelets. Snap the robot blocks together and the magnetic faces do the rest. Every unique arrangement is a new robot with novel behaviors emerging from the construction.

Logical thinking, patterns and sequencing are developed as children problem-solve to put together their creations.</p>
