            <p>Have you ever wondered if there is one particular coding robot that is better than any other? When it comes to coding toys for kids, I look for coding robot toys that can be screen-based or unplugged, connected or not. The more options a coding bot has, the higher a chance I will be interested. 

There are so many different toy options out there to help kids learn to code that I can be really picky when it comes to what I purchase for my boys. For example, I have had a chance to experiment with two different robots for kids from Ozobot. These two ozobot robots would be at the top of my list of highly engaging, extremely user-friendly multi-use learning tool! </p>

            <p>Ozobot is one of the smallest programmable robots in the world, measuring 2.54 cm in diameter and height but equipped with a powerful brain. It is a great tool to teach the basics of programming in a fun and interactive way for children from 6 years old.</p>
